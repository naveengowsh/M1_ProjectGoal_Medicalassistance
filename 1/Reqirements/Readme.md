# Defining Our System

 # Research
    Medicine store administration in hospitals is a time-consuming and laborious operation, with limited resources devoted to the work and a low level of IT use. Due to a variety of fundamental variables, the automation process is lengthy, and it is being hampered by rising inventory levels and mounting medication procurement costs. Medical businesses are on the lookout for services that are precise and dependable when it comes to offering services to clients and employees. Every shop is attempting to computerise its operations in order to provide better customer service. In medical shops, the medical store management system is utilised to keep track of medicine supply inventories. This system allows the store manager to keep track of and manage all of the medical shop's operations.
