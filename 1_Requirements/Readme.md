# Requirements
The technique utilised in medical shops for drug stock inventory is known as the pharma store management system. This system allows the store manager to keep track of and manage all of the medical shop's operations. Medical Shop Management System can be used in medical settings when manual procedures are used. The goal of this research is to minimise the amount of time and effort required by humans. This programme also has a user-friendly UI. The project's goal is to create a medical store management system that will simplify inventory management by reducing the complications of record keeping and paperwork.

## Research
 Medicine store administration in hospitals is a time-consuming and laborious operation, with limited resources devoted to the work and a low level of IT use. Due to a variety of fundamental variables, the automation process is lengthy, and it is being hampered by rising inventory levels and mounting medication procurement costs. Medical businesses are on the lookout for services that are precise and dependable when it comes to offering services to clients and employees. Every shop is attempting to computerise its operations in order to provide better customer service. In medical shops, the medical store management system is utilised to keep track of medicine supply inventories. This system allows the store manager to keep track of and manage all of the medical shop's operations.
